<h1>Mobile World Station</h1>

<p> This is the Mobile World Station where we sell products that we are sure you will love and enjoy</p>

<p> Meet the new iPhone 17. Designed with contoured edges, thinner borders, and durable materials like Ceramic Shield 2 on the front, it looks — and stays — beautiful. You can see and do more of everything you love on a 6.3‑inch Super Retina XDR display.5 And enjoy smoother scrolling and more immersive gaming with ProMotion, with an adaptive refresh rate up to 120Hz. Take it for a spin. The new front camera gives you flexible ways to frame your photos and videos — and so much more. Tap to expand the field of view and rotate from portrait to landscape without moving your iPhone. And when others join the shot, the field of view expands so you get more friends in your selfies. iPhone 17 has a 48MP Fusion Main camera with a 2x optical-quality telephoto, and a 48MP Fusion Ultra Wide camera with 4x the resolution of the Ultra Wide camera on iPhone 16. And now Ultra Wide photos are 24MP by default, the perfect file size for high‑quality storing and sharing. So you’ll get stunning, super-high-resolution shots — up close or far away, indoors and out, in conditions that go from bright to low light. And at 256GB, it has double the starting storage of the previous model.7 So you can capture to your heart’s content — and beyond. The A19 chip powers everything you do on iPhone, including Apple Intelligence features like Live Translation and Image Playground, and ProMotion for playing advanced AAA games. And with all-day battery life, you can work, watch and wander with no worries. If you need a quick top‑up, just 10 minutes of charge gives you up to 8 hours of video playback with a high-wattage adapter.9</p>
